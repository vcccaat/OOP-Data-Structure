If a day is a public holiday, students are not required to attend the labs held on that day. There will be no points for these labs for only those students who originally are supposed to attend these labs; other students are not affected. As different students may be affected by different public holidays, the final total lab points will be normalized according to the number of labs a student has to take. However, although a student may not need to attend a lab on a day that happens to be a public holiday, we strongly encourage the student to still go over the materials of that lab and try to finish it. Labs help students review what they are taught in lectures and get ready for the next lab.
